//The rate-monotonic scheduler is a scheduling algorithm that assigns priorities to periodic tasks based on their time periods.
//This means that tasks with shorter time periods are given higher priorities, and tasks with longer time periods are given
//lower priorities. This algorithm is popular because it is simple to implement and has proven to be effective in many
//real-time systems.

//This code defines a Task struct that represents a periodic task with a period and a deadline. It also defines a
//RateMonotonicScheduler struct that holds a slice of tasks and implements the rate-monotonic scheduling algorithm.
//The RateMonotonicScheduler has a Schedule method that sorts the tasks by period in ascending order and then executes them
//according to the rate-monotonic algorithm.

//One potential issue with the rate-monotonic scheduling algorithm is that it only considers the
//period of each task when assigning priorities, and it does not take into account the workload of the
//tasks or the capabilities of the system. This means that it may not always produce an optimal schedule,
//and it may result in some tasks missing their deadlines if the system is not able to handle the workload.

//Another issue with the rate-monotonic scheduling algorithm is that it assumes that all tasks are periodic and have
//fixed periods. This may not always be the case in real-time systems, where tasks may have variable periods or may not
//be periodic at all. In such cases, the rate-monotonic algorithm may not be applicable, and a different scheduling
//algorithm may be needed.
