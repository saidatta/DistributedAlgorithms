First, let's define the data model for our priority queue. We will use a Redis sorted set to represent the queue, where the score of each element is its priority. The element itself will be the value in the sorted set.

To implement the enqueue operation, we can use the ZADD command to add an element to the sorted set with the desired priority as the score.

Copy code
def enqueue(conn, element, priority):
conn.zadd("queue", element, priority)
To implement the dequeue operation, we can use the ZRANGE command to get the element with the lowest priority (highest score), and then use the ZREM command to remove it from the sorted set.

Copy code
def dequeue(conn):
# Get the element with the highest priority (lowest score)
result = conn.zrange("queue", 0, 0, withscores=True)
if not result:
return None
element, _ = result[0]
# Remove the element from the queue
conn.zrem("queue", element)
return element
To implement the peek operation, we can use the ZRANGE command to get the element with the lowest priority (highest score) without removing it from the queue.

Copy code
def peek(conn):
# Get the element with the highest priority (lowest score)
result = conn.zrange("queue", 0, 0, withscores=True)
if not result:
return None
element, _ = result[0]
return element
This is just one example of how you could implement a distributed priority queue using Redis. There are many other ways you could do this, and the specific approach you choose will depend on your specific needs and constraints.
