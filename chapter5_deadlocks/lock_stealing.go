package chapter5_deadlocks

//Lock stealing is a technique used in database systems to improve concurrency and reduce the likelihood of deadlocks.
//It involves forcibly releasing locks that are held by transactions that have been blocked for a long time, and
//allowing other transactions to acquire the locks instead.

//In a database system, transactions can be blocked when they try to acquire a lock on a resource that is already held
//by another transaction. If the transaction that holds the lock is unable to complete quickly, the blocked transaction
//can become stuck waiting for the lock to be released. This can cause performance problems and increase the likelihood
//of deadlocks.

//To avoid these problems, the database system can use lock stealing to forcibly release the locks that are held by
//blocked transactions. When a transaction has been blocked for a certain amount of time, the database system can
//choose to steal the lock from the blocking transaction and allow the blocked transaction to proceed. This can help
//to improve concurrency and reduce the likelihood of deadlocks.

//However, it is important to use lock stealing carefully, as it can cause problems if it is not done correctly.
//For example, if the blocking transaction was in the middle of updating data when its lock was stolen, the data could
//be left in an inconsistent state. For this reason, it is important to carefully consider the implications of lock
//stealing before using it in a database system.
